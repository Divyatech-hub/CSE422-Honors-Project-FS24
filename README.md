# Topic - NIC Gateway Optimization

### By - Divyalakshmi

## Introduction
This is my submisison for the honors project in CSE 422 - Computer Networks at Michigan State University. This proejct aims to optimize network performance by dynamically selecting the best Network Interface Card (NIC) based on real-time latency measurements. The system continuously monitors multiple NICs, pings selected target websites, and determines the optimal NIC for network traffic based on the lowest Round-Trip Time (RTT). The implementation includes a real- time dashboard using Streamlit to visualize NIC performance.

## Setup and Execution Steps

1. In a terminal session, SSH into the remote server.
   
   ``ssh firstname@IP_ADDRESS``
   ``password: PID``
2. Clone this github repository.
3. Change the directory to where the Python file resides.
4. Ensure dependencies are installed.
   
   `` sudo pip3 install streamlit pandas netifaces matplotlib``
5. Run the Python program to launch the Steamlit app. This takes a while to complete its execution, i.e. pinging all the respective target websites to get the data for the RTTs.
   
  `` streamlit run honorsfinal1.py ``
  
6. Open another terminal session side by side. Implement Port Forwarding using the following command:
   
  `` ssh -L [PORT # used by Streamlit]:[IP Address of Remote Server]:[PORT # used by Streamlit]: -N -f [netid]@scully.egr.msu.edu ``

  `` Example: ssh -L 8501:35.9.42.236:8501 -N -f varadhad@scully.egr.msu.edu ``
  
7. Access the NIC GUI Dashboard by navigating to

   ``http://localhost:[PORT # used by Streamlit]``
   
   `` Example: http://localhost:8501``

## Future Plans
1. Extend Performance Metrics: Include packet loss, jitter, and bandwidth alongside RTT measurements.
2. Enhance Visualization: Add real-time alerts and a comparison mode for historical NIC performance.
3. Mobile-Friendly UI: Optimize the Streamlit dashboard for viewing on mobile devices.
4. Predicting RTT with AI: Using linear regression (or other models) to predict RTT based on history for a particular destination IP address.
